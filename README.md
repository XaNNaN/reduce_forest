# reduce_forest
This rep contains my graduation work with graphs in university. Reducing forest to a tree with the smallest D.

The practical task is to add additional dimensions to the design dimensions to ensure more convenient production and increased lifespan.

Should contain:
  Generator, producing a tree and turns it into forest by removing some of graph edges;
  Solver, making a tree from forest;
  Plotter, visualusates process.
