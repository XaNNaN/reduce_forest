# reduce_forest
This rep contains my graduation work with graphs in university. Reducing forest to a tree with the smallest D.

The practical task is to add additional dimensions to the design dimensions to ensure more convenient production and increased lifespan.

Should contain:
  A generator that creates a tree and turns it into a forest by removing some edges of the graph;
  A solver that creates a tree from a forest;
  Plotter, which visualizes the process.
